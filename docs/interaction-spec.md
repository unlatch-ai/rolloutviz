# RLViz interaction specification (v1)

Binding spec for the viewer's structure and behavior. Supersedes
`ui-information-architecture.md` and the layout assumptions in
`trajectory-workspace-v2.md` (both retained as historical evidence).
Working reference implementations of the interaction model live in
`web/concepts/*.html` — treat them as executable spec for feel and keys,
not as production code or visual design.

Every screen must be describable in this spec's vocabulary and remain
operable from both keyboard and pointer input.

## 1. Modes

The rack and arrangement model in `workspace-spec.md` supersedes this section's
top-level mode swaps. The mode descriptions below remain vocabulary for the
equivalent Browse, Read, and Compare arrangements.

Three modes, one overlay class. No other top-level surfaces.

- **Browse** — home: everything the daemon knows (sources, runs, cases,
  groups) as one navigable collection whose fidelity ladder changes the
  single rail representation in place. Triage (attention ordering, one-key
  verdict tags, shrinking unresolved queue) is a capability of Browse when
  the collection is a cohort. Search/filter narrows in place.
- **Read** — one trajectory. Default only for single-trajectory sources or
  deep links.
- **Compare** — 2..N trajectories, stage-aligned. Entered from Browse
  (mark set + `v`) or Read (vs reference).
- **Overlays** — search, command palette, keymap help `?`, artifact viewer,
  raw-source inspector. Overlays stack on a mode; `Esc` dismisses topmost
  first, never destructive.

Browse is the hub; every descent remembers the Browse state (filter,
projection, queue position) it came from.

## 2. Read mode at t=0

Deterministic layout per source type (a hanging protocol, never
user-rearranged panes). Reading order:

1. **Verdict header** — task identity; outcome per judge (verifier, reward,
   grader — disagreement shown, never collapsed); termination reason.
   Every verdict element links to its evidence event.
2. **Shape strip** (dominant object) — the whole trajectory on one shared
   axis: episode bands, event texture (shape encodes kind, never hue),
   context-pressure lane, health/reward curve, landmark marks. Pathologies
   must be legible as shapes (retry comb, context ramp, compaction cliff).
3. **Selected moment** — pre-placed at the first meaningful anomaly (first
   error, else first divergence, else first finding, else event 0); its
   content renders in the detail region.

No transcript wall at t=0; prose is descended into.

## 3. Selection model

- One selection state per mode; keyboard, mouse, search, deep links, and
  the strip all read/write it.
- Selection ≠ focus ≠ hover. Hover is a *skimmer*: previews content in a
  fixed slot without moving selection or scrolling; mouse-out restores.
- Every event has a stable short address (seq index; `turn.step` when
  canonical), typeable via goto, used in deep links.
- Reveal-once: deliberate navigation/deep-link restore scrolls to selection
  exactly once; unrelated renders never yank a scrolled surface.

## 4. Depth, fidelity, zoom (three orthogonal controls)

- **Depth** (`Enter` descend / `Esc` ascend): Surface → Episodes → Events →
  Source. Layers are representations of one axis; descending changes
  representation and screen allocation, not place. Other layers compress to
  orientation strips; the shared axis and playhead stay visible everywhere.
- **Fidelity** (`[` / `]`): how much each unit renders — hairline strip →
  marks → texture → glyph rows → one-line previews → full content. On the
  rail this is the only representation control; there is no projection toggle.
- **Axis zoom** (`+` / `-` / `0` fit): which span of the axis fills the
  viewport, anchored on the selection — the selected event's screen
  position does not move across zoom (verified property of the concept
  implementation; keep it testable). Navigation outside the window pans it.
- Anchor stability across all three: the selected moment stays fixed on
  screen; the world moves around it.
- `j`/`k` traverse the active layer's units. Landmark jumps (`e` error,
  `c` context, `r` reward, `a` finding) work at any depth.
- Registration: an episode's raw events render beneath it at the same axis
  extent; a summary that cannot point at its constituent records may not be
  drawn.

## 5. Browse / triage

- Queue ordered by attention-worthiness (findings, judge disagreement,
  marginal reward first); confident-clean sinks and can be swept in bulk.
- Rows are caterpillars: verdict glyph + strip with length ∝ event count.
  Nominal renders silent; abnormal carries marks.
- `n`/`p` move to next/prev rollout *while staying in Read*, preserving
  depth, filter, and aligned position.
- One-key verdict tags advance the queue; the unresolved count visibly
  shrinks; "next unresolved" skips triaged rows. Tags are local annotations
  (sidecar/cache), never writes to the source.
- Tagging a rollout with unvisited findings says so instead of silently
  advancing.

## 6. Compare

- One side is the designated reference; everything renders relative to it.
- **Alignment is on stages, never step index or tool-call order.**
  Independent rollouts permute tool order immediately and meaninglessly.
  Anchors resolve in order: adapter-declared episode boundaries → configured
  anchors (presentation config) → agent-annotation sidecar stages →
  outcome-only. The UI states which tier produced the alignment.
- Within a stage, sides are independent-length and unaligned; tool-order
  permutations and reasoning-text differences with identical behavior are
  not divergence. Divergence is the first stage whose behavior differs in
  an outcome-relevant way (`d` jumps there).
- Divergence curve: cumulative cost delta (steps/tokens) vs reference per
  stage.
- N-way: rollouts as rows, stage boundaries as shared anchors, per-stage
  cell width ∝ steps, per-stage delta vs reference. Pair compare is N=2
  with richer in-stage rendering and per-stage lockstep scrolling.

## 7. Replay

Exists for hindsight control only: truncates everything after the playhead
so the reader judges the next action against exactly what the model could
see, then reveals it (`→` step, optional auto-advance). All lanes truncate
together. Sequence-only sources replay by reveal-in-order; no wall clock
implied. Exit restores the record, playhead becomes selection.

## 8. Derived-information tiers

- **Tier D — deterministic** (core/adapters/analyzers): parsing, addresses,
  counts, retry/loop detection, context lifecycle, outcome extraction,
  anchor candidates. Always available; the UI must be fully functional on
  Tier D alone.
- **Tier C — configured semantics** (validated data, per plugin model):
  glyph/label/palette bindings, columns, landmark and anchor definitions,
  keymaps.
- **Tier A — agent-derived annotations** (sidecar JSON, schema-validated):
  stage labels, root-cause notes, clustering, titles. Produced by external
  coding agents against a documented schema; RLViz never calls a model.
  Rendered with visible inferred-provenance; never overrides Tier D;
  deleting the sidecar restores the deterministic view.

## 9. Command grammar

Stable command IDs in the existing registry (`web/src/commands.ts`);
bindings are remaps; IDs never change meaning. Letters are commands only
while a reading surface has focus. Every pointer action has a keyboard
route. `?` shows active-scope bindings.

Keep existing bindings. Additions (conflict-checked per scope):

| Command ID | Default | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `trajectory.nextRollout` / `previousRollout` | `n` / `p` | trajectory |
| `workspace.openDetail` | `d` | trajectory |
| `workspace.moveMode` | `Ctrl+m`, then arrows; `Ctrl+m`/`Esc` exits | workspace |
| `workspace.resizeMode` | `Ctrl+w`, then arrows; `Ctrl+w`/`Esc` exits | workspace |
| `trajectory.ascend` | `Escape` | trajectory |
| `trajectory.markIn` / `markOut` | `i` / `Shift+O` | trajectory |
| `trajectory.goto` | `:` | trajectory |
| `trajectory.replay` | `Shift+R` | trajectory |
| `trajectory.pivotAggregate` | `.` | trajectory |
| `trajectory.dropMarker` / `cycleMarkers` | `m` / `Shift+M` | trajectory |
| `view.fidelityUp` / `fidelityDown` | `]` / `[` | all (collection representation) |
| `view.zoomIn` / `zoomOut` / `zoomFit` | `+` / `-` / `0` | trajectory, comparison |
| `view.zoomInAll` / `zoomOutAll` / `zoomFitAll` | `>` / `<` / `)` | workspace |
| `comparison.toggleDivergenceCurve` | `Shift+D` | comparison |

## 10. Visual and semantic invariants

1. Selection never moves except by explicit user action or first-open
   pre-placement.
2. Shared axis + playhead visible at every mode and depth.
3. Grayscale base; color only for selection, focus, failure (by class),
   context lifecycle, evidence. Categories get shape/position/texture,
   never hue. Nominal is silent — no pass-badge spam.
4. Flag budget: ≤3 severities; identical findings aggregate; dozens of
   badges on one rollout is an analyzer-contract bug.
5. Provenance (source / adapter / analyzer / inferred) distinguishable at
   every depth; every summary one descent from raw source.
6. Icons: bundled open-source set (Lucide; embedded, no CDN) mapped from a
   semantic token table `kind → {icon, unicode glyph, label}`; the glyph
   column serves high-density views; Tier C rebinds by *naming*
   bundled icons, never supplying image data.
7. Ship complete defaults (icons, 2–3 validated palettes); customization is
   token override with contrast validation, not design-from-scratch.
8. Existing accessibility/performance gates hold: AA contrast, full
   keyboard completion, reduced motion, 10k-event smoothness, zero
   outbound requests.

### Colors

The grayscale chrome uses `--page` (`#f9f9f7` light / `#0d0d0d` dark),
`--surface` (`#fcfcfb` / `#1a1a19`), `--ink` (`#0b0b0b` / `#ffffff`),
`--ink-secondary` (`#52514e` / `#c3c2b7`), `--muted` (`#898781` in both
modes), and `--hairline` (`#e1e0d9` / `#2c2c2a`). Selection is achromatic:
an ink playhead, a 1.5px ink outline, and a low-alpha ink wash. Focus uses a
2px `--ctx` outline.

Exactly four semantic hue tokens are available:

- `--ctx`: `#2a78d6` light / `#3987e5` dark for context lifecycle,
  compaction marks, context-lane tint, and focus.
- `--fail-policy`: `#d03b3b` in both modes for policy or model failures and
  failing judge chips.
- `--fail-infra`: `#ec835a` in both modes for infrastructure or environment
  failures. It is never used for text and always has a shape or label because
  it is below 3:1 contrast on the light theme.
- `--good`: `#006300` light / `#0ca30c` dark, used only for verifier-pass chip
  text and ahead deltas in comparison views; it is never a badge background.

Mild-attention states such as stale, truncated, or partial data use muted ink
with dashed or hollow shapes and no hue. Inferred and Tier-A data use muted ink
with a hatched texture and no hue.

## 11. CLI control plane

The browser is the only trajectory renderer. The CLI provides setup, format
inspection, structured trajectory queries, and named-workspace commands. A
human or coding agent can choose trajectory IDs and update an already-open GUI
without duplicating the visual interaction model in a terminal.
