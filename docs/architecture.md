# System architecture

This document is the current structural map of RLViz. It describes what exists
in the repository today, the boundaries that must remain stable, and the main
request paths. Product intent lives in `product-spec.md`; target UI behavior
lives in `ui-information-architecture.md`.

## Product shape

RLViz is one native Go binary with an embedded React application. It reads
existing rollout artifacts, normalizes them into a versioned canonical model,
indexes them locally, and serves a private browser UI from loopback.

```

The binary contains no model and does not execute recorded tools. Coding agents
operate the CLI and can author project-local adapters; RLViz remains the viewer.

## Runtime paths

### Open a source

```text
rlviz open SOURCE
  1. resolve the source path without modifying it
  2. load or start the per-user daemon
  3. send an authenticated registration request
  4. choose the canonical decoder or an explicitly trusted adapter
  5. validate and commit the first bounded record batch
  6. return an authenticated viewer URL
  7. continue indexing and watching in the daemon
  8. open the browser and let the CLI exit promptly
```

The daemon records `indexing`, `complete`, `refreshing`, or `failed`. An initial
source becomes visible after a valid header and first event batch. A refresh
keeps the prior valid generation queryable until its replacement validates and
commits atomically. Invalid or cancelled refreshes never replace known-good
data.

### Read in the browser

The browser receives the daemon token in the URL fragment. Fragments are not
sent in HTTP requests or referrers; the application reads the token and sends
it as a bearer credential to versioned local API routes.

The UI requests trajectory metadata and a bounded first page, then loads later
event, signal, and artifact pages while indexing continues. Event lists are
virtualized. Raw source locations remain available so a normalized event can be
traced back to its original record.

### Run a plugin

Adapters and analyzers are subprocesses using versioned JSON/NDJSON protocols.
RLViz never uses Go native plugins.

```text
manifest -> schema validation -> path and digest trust check
         -> copy executable plugin files to a private snapshot
         -> execute the verified snapshot with bounded I/O
         -> validate every returned record
```

Stdout is protocol-only. Stderr is captured for diagnostics. Any plugin edit
changes the digest and invalidates trust.

## Canonical and derived data

Canonical v1alpha1 entities are run, case, group, trajectory, event, signal,
artifact, and complete. Relationships use stable IDs so large sources can be
streamed without constructing a nested in-memory graph.

Adapters own source-to-canonical mapping. Analyzers produce deterministic,
removable findings and signals. Alignment and compact paths are derived views;
they do not rewrite the source or imply that independently sampled trajectories
were literal execution branches.

The current generic event envelope is adequate for basic viewing but does not
yet standardize message roles, tool spans, context compaction, verifier
evidence, or context-window accounting. Those semantics must be designed from
real formats before a protocol revision. See `data-model.md`.

## Frontend structure

The React application has three levels of research surfaces:

- `App.tsx`: trajectory loading, routing, shared event selection, landmark rail,
  and selected-event-first inspector
- `ResearchViews.tsx`: virtualized transcript and outcome/evidence views
- `TrajectoryTabs.tsx`: transcript, raw event timeline, and outcome switching
- `GroupView.tsx`: trajectory cohort table and compact behavioral paths
- `ComparisonView.tsx`: aligned pair comparison and divergence navigation
- `AnalysisPanel.tsx` and `ArtifactPanel.tsx`: derived findings and artifacts

`research.ts` derives conservative, provenance-labeled display semantics from
canonical records. `commands.ts` is the single command/keymap registry.
`api.ts` is the typed daemon client, `types.ts` mirrors API records, and
`VirtualList.tsx` bounds DOM work for long lists. Context compaction is currently
recognized only through an explicit canonical `context:*` alignment key; richer
context membership remains a future protocol decision.

## Security invariants

- Bind only to loopback.
- Require the per-daemon secret for source registration and data reads.
- Make no outbound requests during normal viewing.
- Treat rollout sources and referenced data as read-only.
- Resolve symlinks and prevent artifact reads outside registered roots.
- Render trace HTML as text or sanitized content, never trusted markup.
- Never execute recorded commands, tool calls, or model output.
- Execute external code only after explicit path-and-digest trust.
- Keep caches separate, discoverable, and removable.

These are product boundaries, not implementation details. Changing one requires
an explicit product decision and an ADR.

## Performance invariants

- Decode and validate streams incrementally.
- Commit bounded SQLite batches.
- Paginate events, signals, artifacts, and group summaries.
- Virtualize long browser collections.
- Preserve the old valid generation during refresh.
- Cache derived analysis by input and implementation digest.
- Profile representative traces before introducing lower-level complexity.

Quality budgets and representative fixture requirements live in `testing.md`.

## Where to start a change

| Change | Read first | Typical implementation surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLI or machine output | `onboarding.md`, public command docs | `cmd/rlviz`, command tests |
| Canonical semantics | `data-model.md`, protocol docs | model, schemas, fixtures, index, API, UI |
| Adapter/analyzer behavior | `plugin-model.md`, relevant protocol | plugins, schemas, fixtures, conformance tests |
| Viewer behavior | `ui-information-architecture.md`, `design-system.md` | `web/src`, API only when required |
| Daemon or cache | ADR 0001/0003, this document | daemon, app, index, server |
| Release/install | `releasing.md` | workflows, package, formula, scripts |

Keep this document current when a subsystem, boundary, request path, or
repository responsibility changes.
