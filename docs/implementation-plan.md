# Implementation plan

The implementation is organized as vertical milestones. Each milestone should leave a usable, testable product rather than a collection of disconnected subsystems.

## Current delivery

Milestones 0–7 are implemented in the repository: versioned contracts and fixtures, the single-trajectory viewer, authenticated daemon lifecycle, progressive SQLite indexing, paginated and virtualized reads, growing-file updates, trusted external adapters and analyzers, rollout-group summaries, compact behavioral paths, deterministic long-trace comparison, cached loop/retry findings, release automation, and verified installers. `v0.1.0` is published with native macOS/Linux archives, checksums, attestations, a curl installer, and the `unlatch-ai/tap/rolloutviz` Homebrew formula. Initial npm publication remains an account-level bootstrap step.

## Milestone 0: contracts and fixtures

### Deliverables

- Canonical entity and event schemas
- Plugin manifest schema
- Adapter request and NDJSON response schemas
- Small linear trajectory fixture
- Rollout-group fixture
- Branched trajectory fixture
- Malformed and adversarial fixtures
- Architecture decision records for storage, plugins, and daemon lifecycle

### Exit criteria

- Schemas validate every fixture.
- Stable IDs and relationship constraints are specified.
- A contributor can understand the format without reading Go code.

## Milestone 1: single-trajectory vertical slice

### Deliverables

- `rlviz open`
- Foreground local server
- Built-in canonical JSONL adapter
- Embedded React UI
- Three-pane trajectory layout
- Event selection and raw payload inspection
- Basic keyboard navigation
- Text, JSON, image, and log artifact renderers

### Exit criteria

- One release binary opens the canonical fixture.
- Every rendered event links to its raw source record.
- The source remains unchanged.
- Browser tests cover the primary navigation flow.

## Milestone 2: daemon, streaming, and large files

### Deliverables

- Background daemon lifecycle
- Loopback authentication token
- SQLite metadata and search index
- Incremental JSONL parsing
- Source byte offsets
- Paginated HTTP API
- Virtualized event list
- File watching and append-only updates
- Cache status and cleanup commands

### Exit criteria

- `rlviz open` returns without holding the invoking shell.
- A 10,000-event trajectory scrolls smoothly.
- Large files reach first render before full indexing completes.
- Appended records appear without reopening the viewer.

## Milestone 3: external adapters and agent workflow

### Deliverables

- Plugin discovery and manifest parsing
- Adapter `probe` and `stream` process host
- Trust-by-path-and-digest flow
- `plugin init`, `list`, `validate`, and `doctor`
- Python adapter template
- Golden fixture test harness
- Structured CLI diagnostics
- Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor integration instructions

### Exit criteria

- A coding agent can scaffold an adapter from an unsupported sample.
- The validator identifies the exact invalid record and field.
- A trusted Python adapter opens a source without rebuilding RolloutViz.
- A changed adapter is not executed until trusted again.

## Milestone 4: rollout groups

### Deliverables

- Run, case, and group navigation
- Trajectory summary table
- Reward, pass, length, token, latency, error, and termination summaries
- Sorting and filtering
- Best/worst shortcuts
- Behavioral path fingerprints

### Exit criteria

- A researcher can identify representative success and failure trajectories without opening each one.
- Aggregates are computed incrementally from indexed fields.
- Group membership remains source-native and distinguishable from user selections.

## Milestone 5: pair comparison and divergence

### Deliverables

- Comparison-set model
- Deterministic event fingerprints
- Sequence alignment engine
- Aligned two-lane viewer
- Common-prefix compression
- First meaningful divergence marker
- State, reward, artifact, and termination differences
- Adapter-provided alignment-key support

### Exit criteria

- Equivalent actions align despite irrelevant text differences.
- Insertions, deletions, retries, and later realignment remain understandable.
- Alignment output has deterministic golden tests.
- Users can deep-link to a divergence.

## Milestone 6: compact paths and analyzers

### Deliverables

- Aggregated behavioral-prefix tree
- Explicit distinction between derived paths and source-native branches
- Analyzer plugin protocol
- Loop and retry analyzer
- Domain-specific signal output
- Cached analysis results with provenance

### Exit criteria

- A rollout group can be summarized without a spaghetti graph.
- Analyzer results identify plugin name, version, and input digest.
- Removing analyzer output never changes source data.

## Milestone 7: open-source release quality

### Deliverables

- macOS arm64/x64 and Linux arm64/x64 releases
- Checksums and signed artifacts
- Homebrew tap
- Reproducible release workflow
- Security policy and threat-model review
- Performance benchmarks
- Adapter-authoring tutorial
- Public example dataset

### Exit criteria

- A clean machine can install and open the example in under one minute.
- Release artifacts require no language runtime.
- Normal viewing makes no outbound requests.
- Documentation covers unsupported formats and safe plugin review.

## Near-term issue sequence

1. Bootstrap the npm package, configure its trusted publisher, and enable automated npm releases.
2. Add a narrow tap-update token so future tags update Homebrew automatically.
3. Validate the clean-machine install-to-open path on Linux; macOS curl and Homebrew paths are verified.
4. Gather real adapter fixtures from environment and post-training workflows.
5. Profile larger rollout groups and tune the existing event, signal, and artifact cursors.
6. Extend comparison sets across sources, runs, and checkpoints after the local single-source workflow is proven.

## Quality gates

Every change should keep these commands green:

```bash
make format
make test
make check
make build
```

Protocol changes require updated schemas, fixtures, and conformance tests. UI behavior changes require a browser-level test when the behavior is externally visible.
