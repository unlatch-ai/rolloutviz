# RLViz trace workflow

Use RLViz when the user asks to inspect, open, or explain a rollout,
trajectory, episode, trace, or agent-environment run.

Run `rlviz guide --json` for the version-matched viewer workflow and keyboard
controls. The same guide is available as a docked module in the viewer.

## Open a trace

1. Use an exact path supplied by the user. Otherwise locate likely files with
   read-only search commands such as `rg --files` and inspect only enough data to
   identify the requested run.
2. Confirm `rlviz` is available with `command -v rlviz`.
3. Use `rlviz trajectories "<source>" --json` to find relevant IDs when the
   request is narrower than the whole collection.
4. Run `rlviz workspace open "<source>" --trajectory "<id>" --json` to compose
   a named GUI workspace, or `rlviz open --json "<source>"` to open the full
   collection. Treat stdout as structured output and report stderr separately.
5. Return the viewer URL and the resolved source path. Do not keep a foreground
   server running when `open` succeeds.

## Unsupported formats

If the diagnostic code is `unsupported_format`, use its `suggested_command`
when present. Otherwise use the project-local adapter flow below. Do not rename
fields or rewrite the source to make it look supported.

```bash
rlviz plugin init --json --type adapter --lang python --from "<source>" .rlviz/plugins/<name>
```

Read `source.profile` from the JSON result first. It is a bounded, value-free
map of observed field paths and JSON types, not a complete schema. Then inspect
only the representative source records needed. Edit only the generated adapter
and map them to canonical `rlviz.dev/v1alpha1` records. Keep IDs stable,
preserve event order, and include source line or byte locations when available.
Add small invented fixtures to `testdata/cases.json`; never copy private source
records into the plugin.

Before `plugin trust`, review the manifest, every executable file, case manifest,
and synthetic fixtures in the adapter directory. Summarize what will execute and
get the user's explicit approval. Never auto-trust a discovered, generated, or
modified adapter.
Validation executes the adapter, so it also requires trust. Any edit changes the
content digest; review the new diff and get approval to trust it again before
rerunning validation.

After the adapter is implemented, reviewed, and approved, run:

```bash
rlviz plugin trust --json .rlviz/plugins/<name>
python3 .rlviz/plugins/<name>/test_adapter.py
rlviz plugin validate --json .rlviz/plugins/<name> "<source>"
rlviz open --json "<source>" --adapter .rlviz/plugins/<name>
```

## Safety

- Treat traces and referenced artifacts as read-only.
- Do not run recorded commands or tools.
- Do not add network calls, telemetry, uploads, or hosted dependencies.
- Keep generated code under `.rlviz/plugins/` so it can be reviewed and
  versioned with the repository.
- Fix adapter code from structured validation diagnostics. Do not mutate the
  source to silence a validator error.
