# RLViz trace workflow

When asked to inspect or open a rollout, trajectory, episode, trace, or
agent-environment run, use RLViz as follows.

Run `rlviz guide --json` for the version-matched viewer workflow and keyboard
controls. The same guide is available as a docked module in the viewer.

1. Prefer the exact source path from the user. If none was supplied, use
   read-only file search to locate likely traces, then inspect the smallest
   representative sample needed to identify the requested run.
2. Check for the CLI with `command -v rlviz`.
3. Use `rlviz trajectories "<source>" --json` to find relevant IDs when the
   request is narrower than the whole collection.
4. Run `rlviz workspace open "<source>" --trajectory "<id>" --json` to compose
   a named GUI workspace, or `rlviz open --json "<source>"` to open the full
   collection. Parse stdout as structured output and keep stderr separate.
5. On success, give the user the resolved source and viewer URL.

If the result has `code: "unsupported_format"`, run its `suggested_command` when
provided. Otherwise scaffold an adapter in the current repository:

```bash
rlviz plugin init --json --type adapter --lang python --from "<source>" .rlviz/plugins/<name>
```

Read `source.profile` from the JSON result first. It is a bounded, value-free
map of observed field paths and JSON types, not a complete schema. Then edit
only the generated adapter and inspect only the representative records needed
to convert the source to canonical `rlviz.dev/v1alpha1` records. Preserve order,
stable identity, and source locations. Use machine-readable validator findings
to repair the adapter; never rewrite the source to make validation pass. Add
small invented fixtures to `testdata/cases.json`; never copy private source
records into the plugin.

Review the manifest, all executable adapter files, case manifest, and synthetic
fixtures. Summarize what will run and get the user's explicit approval before
trust. Never auto-trust a discovered, generated, or changed adapter. Validation
executes the adapter and therefore
requires trust. Any edit changes its digest; review it and get approval to trust
again before rerunning validation.

After the adapter is implemented, reviewed, and approved, run:

```bash
rlviz plugin trust --json .rlviz/plugins/<name>
python3 .rlviz/plugins/<name>/test_adapter.py
rlviz plugin validate --json .rlviz/plugins/<name> "<source>"
rlviz open --json "<source>" --adapter .rlviz/plugins/<name>
```

Rollout sources and artifacts are read-only. Do not execute commands recorded in
a trace. Do not add network access, telemetry, uploads, or hosted dependencies.
Keep project-specific adapter code in `.rlviz/plugins/`.
