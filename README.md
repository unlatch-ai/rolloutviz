# RolloutViz

Visualize and compare agent rollouts.

RolloutViz is a local, open-source viewer for agent trajectories. Point it at a trace, open the viewer, and inspect what the model, tools, grader, and environment did step by step.

The long-term goal is a lightweight workbench for people building agent environments and post-training systems:

- open one trajectory without importing it into a hosted platform
- inspect messages, actions, observations, rewards, grader output, and artifacts
- compare trajectories from the same rollout group
- find the first meaningful behavioral divergence
- extend support for private formats with local adapter plugins
- invoke the viewer directly or through coding agents such as Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor

## Status

RolloutViz accepts canonical v1alpha1 NDJSON, validates and indexes it locally, starts a loopback-only daemon, and opens an embedded keyboard-first viewer:

```bash
rlviz open ./path/to/trajectory.jsonl
```

Build it and open the included fixture:

```bash
make web-install
make build
./bin/rlviz open ./fixtures/canonical/linear.ndjson
```

`rlviz open` starts or reuses a private loopback daemon and returns after registration. Use `rlviz status` and `rlviz stop` to inspect or stop it; `rlviz serve` remains the explicit foreground debugging mode.

The daemon incrementally decodes sources into a private SQLite cache, watches opened files for changes, and serves paginated events to a virtualized UI. Group sources add a sortable trajectory table, aggregate outcomes, compact behavioral paths, and deterministic two-run divergence comparison.

Inspect the local SQLite index, or remove it after stopping the daemon:

```bash
rlviz cache status
rlviz stop
rlviz cache clean
```

Both cache commands accept `--json`. Cleanup only removes `index.sqlite` and its SQLite `-wal` and `-shm` siblings.

Private formats can use project-local process adapters:

```bash
./bin/rlviz plugin init --type adapter --lang python .rolloutviz/plugins/customer-trace
# Review the generated executable code before trusting it.
./bin/rlviz plugin trust .rolloutviz/plugins/customer-trace
./bin/rlviz plugin validate .rolloutviz/plugins/customer-trace ./path/to/trace
./bin/rlviz open ./path/to/trace --adapter .rolloutviz/plugins/customer-trace
```

See [`docs/adapter-authoring.md`](docs/adapter-authoring.md) and the working [`simple-jsonl` example](examples/adapters/simple-jsonl).

## Install

Release archives contain one native binary and require no language runtime. Install the latest verified archive with:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unlatch-ai/rolloutviz/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Set `ROLLOUTVIZ_VERSION` to pin a release and `ROLLOUTVIZ_INSTALL_DIR` to choose the destination. The installer verifies the release checksum before installing both `rlviz` and the `rolloutviz` alias.

On macOS or Linux with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install unlatch-ai/tap/rolloutviz
```

For Node-based environments and coding-agent sandboxes, the same native binary is packaged for npm. npm publication is being bootstrapped; until it is live, use Homebrew or the verified curl installer above.

```bash
npm install --global rolloutviz
```

The npm installer selects the matching macOS or Linux release and verifies its checksum. npm is an installation path only; the viewer itself remains a native Go binary.

## Design principles

- **Local first.** No account, upload, instrumentation SDK, or hosted service required.
- **Read existing artifacts.** Adapters translate stored trajectory formats into a small canonical event model.
- **Agent extensible.** Unsupported formats should produce enough structured context for a coding agent to implement and validate an adapter.
- **Lossless inspection.** Normalized events always link back to their raw source records.
- **Fast by default.** Large files are streamed and indexed instead of loaded wholesale.
- **Comparison aware.** Rollout groups and parent relationships exist in the data model before their full UI ships.

## Repository map

- [`docs/product-spec.md`](docs/product-spec.md) defines the user experience and scope.
- [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) defines the initial technical architecture.
- [`docs/adapter-protocol.md`](docs/adapter-protocol.md) defines the external adapter boundary.
- [`docs/implementation-plan.md`](docs/implementation-plan.md) breaks the work into testable milestones.
- [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) documents native, Homebrew, and npm publication.
- [`integrations/`](integrations/) contains instructions for Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor.

## Development

The core is written in Go. The local React and TypeScript viewer is compiled and embedded in the release binary.

```bash
make web-install
make check
make build
./bin/rlviz version
```
