# RLViz

Visualize and compare agent rollouts locally.

RLViz opens canonical trajectories, rollout cohorts, and trusted adapter output in a keyboard-first browser UI or TUI. It reads sources without mutating them and makes no outbound requests during viewing.

Open a local trace without installing anything at [app.rlviz.dev](https://app.rlviz.dev). Your trace is parsed in that tab and never uploaded.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://rlviz.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Or through a package manager:

```bash
npm install -g rlviz
brew install TheSnakeFang/tap/rlviz
```

Installation and setup documentation: [rlviz.dev/onboarding.html](https://rlviz.dev/onboarding.html).

## 30-second quickstart

```bash
rlviz init
rlviz demo
rlviz inspect ./path/to/rollout.ndjson
rlviz open ./path/to/rollout.ndjson
```

If `inspect` reports an unsupported format, scaffold a project-local adapter, review it, and explicitly trust it before execution. The [adapter authoring guide](https://rlviz.dev/adapter-authoring.html) covers that boundary.
