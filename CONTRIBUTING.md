# Contributing

RolloutViz is early. Issues and focused pull requests are welcome, especially around real trajectory formats and inspection workflows.

Before starting a larger change, open an issue describing the user workflow and the source format or behavior involved.

## Development

Requirements:

- Go 1.24 or newer
- Node.js 22 or newer

Run the local checks:

```bash
make web-install
make check
make build
```

Protocol changes must include updated schemas, fixtures, and conformance tests. Avoid committing proprietary traces, credentials, model reasoning, customer data, or generated caches.

## Pull requests

Keep changes scoped and explain the concrete workflow they improve. Include verification commands and screenshots for visible UI changes.
